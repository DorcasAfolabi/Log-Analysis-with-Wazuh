# Log-Analysis-with-Wazuh
I created a SOC in a Segmented Network for Baztech Inc.

## Project Overview
Baztech Inc., a startup specializing in securing data and infrastructure across diverse legal platforms and departments, faces a critical visibility gap in its segmented network environment. Current security logs are dispersed across multiple devices with no centralized collection or analysis, limiting the ability to detect and respond to cross-department threats. With rising cyber risks to critical sectors like food and agriculture, the company aims to simulate a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment to replicate real-world attack scenarios, centralize log management, and enable robust threat detection. This initiative will establish clear processes for monitoring, analyzing, and responding to suspicious activities within each network segment, enhancing both incident response readiness and overall infrastructure resilience.
